## The Booster conference website

The content of this site is written in Markdown. Here's a handy markdown [cheatsheet](https://github.com/adam-p/markdown-here/wiki/Markdown-Cheatsheet). 

The markdown files are translated to HTML using a program called [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/), and hosted on Heroku. Anything pushed to main will end up on the website within half a minute or so.
