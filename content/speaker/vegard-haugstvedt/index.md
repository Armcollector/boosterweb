Vegard is an experienced frontend developer that specializes in accessibility. His passion is making good user experiences for everyone, not Some User Experience (or SUX, first coined by Billy Gregory). He wants to bring back the "engineering" in software engineering, building software with the same care and intolerance for errors as engineers building bridges and buildings.
