In this workshop we'll be exploring different git-techniques, that will improve how you present your work to your teammates.

The workshop will be made up of demonstrations and prepared assignments.

Contrary to popular belief, you do *not* need to be fluent in git command line in order to work with Git efficiently.

I will be using a PC with a GUI client: GitExtensions.

Target audience:
- People who are relatively new to Git.
- People who are new to having their code reviewed by teammates.
- People experienced with Git and code review, but who aren't using rebase on a daily basis.

Note:
A familiarity with html and javascript is required for understanding the assignments.
