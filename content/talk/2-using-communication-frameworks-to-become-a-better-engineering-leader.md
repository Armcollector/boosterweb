This is the talk version of this blog post [1], in which I want to inspire the audience to invest more of their resources in improving their communication skills, which is something we as engineers neglect. However, communication is the source of basically all problems we encounter at work, so I gave it a look from a developers point of view and will show the audience some techniques that provide a structured approach to better communication.

I could do this also as a 30 minute talk. But I am comfortable with distilling the gist of it down to 10 minutes.
