It's been several years since GDPR went into effect. There is no practical way for personal information to be transfered to the U.S. This has left the use of public clouds in a questionable state. This talk will give you a timeline on what has changed and why. I will give you insight from my time working as the DPO in a Healthtech-startup when Schrems II hit and how we reacted. Most importantly: This talk will give you the information you need to work with, and host, software that handles personal information.
