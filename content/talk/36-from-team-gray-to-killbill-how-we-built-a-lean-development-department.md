In 2016 we had Team Blue, Team Green and Team Gray and we released software every 4th week. We were quite happy - doing Scrum great. But we wanted to do better. Today we release software up to 20 times a day, with our 14 autonomous product teams. Now we have teams like Angry Nerds, SheetStorm, KillBill and Piggy Bank Crew and we do Lean our own way. In this talk you will hear about our Playbook, core principles and awesome work culture for making a great product for 60.000 companies and 250.000 users in Norway.
