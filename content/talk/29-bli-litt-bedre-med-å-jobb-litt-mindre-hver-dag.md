Outline:
The talk is a motivational talk about how to improve working as a developer.  It gives a humourous view of how and why you can apply experiences from gaming to professional life as a developer.  Why you should change your daily work flow to include more practice and how small, but continous improvements of basics skills yield great dividends later on. 

The talk is currently in norwegian, but can be adapted to english if Boosted wants.

I really think this is my best talk so far, and it was very well received in my company.
