Function over aestethics is like a hot potato in most UX- and development environments.
Research on the so called Aestetic Usabillty Effect showes that good visual design can cover up poor usabillity - But should it? Many developers are passionatley committed to usability and won't settle for techical issues being covered up by a pretty user interface. Some may even go as far as claiming that in a world without usability issues, design would become redundant.

From the point-of-view of an artist, illustrator and designer working within the UX-field, I will be sharing my thoughts on the Aestetic Usabillty Effect - a psychological mechanism that makes us percieve what looks better as working better - and I will attempt to get closer to what a user's response to "good design" is actually telling us and discussing how any professional within the field can utillize the value of visual.
